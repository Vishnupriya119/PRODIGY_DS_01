# Population Distribution Visualization
This repository contains the code and analysis for creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in a population.
# Files
'World_Development_Indicator.csv': The dataset containing the population data.
# Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing involved loading the population data from the 'World_Development_Indicator.csv' file and preparing it for visualization.
# Creating the Bar Chart or Histogram
The bar chart or histogram was created using the matplotlib library in Python. The visualization provides a clear representation of the distribution of the chosen variable within the population.
# Usage
To use this repository, simply clone or download the files and run the Task3.ipynb Jupyter notebook to see the bar chart or histogram visualization. You can also modify the code to visualize the distribution of different variables within the population.
